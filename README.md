# P90 Terminal UI

A silly terminal program which simulates shooting a [FN P90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_P90) submachine gun. Built using [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/).

## Controls

[F]ire

[R]eload

[Q]uit

## How to run

In the terminal enter `cargo run`.

## Why?

I wanted to learn Rust but also have fun doing it. I also think terminal UI programs are cool-looking.
